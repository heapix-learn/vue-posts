# vue-posts
CRUD posts from jsonplaceholder via vue/vuex/router

commit to /dev branch

TODO: 
 
  * posts list (AllPosts.vue) 
  * new post (PostCreate.vue)
  
 all the data should be stored in store. to communicate use getters/actions
 
 to make http requests use 'services' package. [example structure](https://github.com/codyseibert/tab-tracker/tree/master/client/src/services)
 
 all code should be pure and clear. do not overwhelm store (!)
